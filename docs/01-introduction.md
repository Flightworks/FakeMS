# Welcome to Fake MS

**Fake MS** (Mission System) is a touch-friendly interface designed for HMI thought experiments. It mimics a "Heads-Down Display" (HDD), providing a simple way for designers to play around with features.

## What does it do?

Fake MS provides a real-time tactical map with several key features:

*   **Tactical Moving Map:** A map that can stay fixed on North or rotate based on where the helicopter is heading.
*   **Smart Interface:** Interactive panels that show flight data like speed, height, and heading, which can be moved to any corner of the screen.
*   **Pie Menu:** A "radial" menu that appears when you touch and hold the map or an icon, allowing for quick actions like dropping a waypoint or engaging a target.

## Who is it for?

This application serves as a prototype for high-fidelity, tactile-first interfaces where rapid spatial awareness is critical.
