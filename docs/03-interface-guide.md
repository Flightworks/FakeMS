# Interface Guide

The Fake MS interface is divided into several key areas designed for easy access during flight operations.

## 1. Tactical Moving Map

The map is the heart of the application.

*   **Navigation**: Pan by dragging with one finger (or mouse) and zoom using the scroll wheel or pinch gestures.
*   **Stabilization Modes**:
    *   **NORTH-UP**: The top of the map is always North.
    *   **HEADING-UP**: The map rotates so that the direction you are facing is always at the top.
*   **Symbology**:
    *   **Blue Square**: Your own helicopter (Ownship).
    *   **Red Diamond**: Hostile or Enemy targets.
    *   **Amber Circle**: Waypoints or points of interest.

## 2. The Pie Menu (Radial Actions)

The Pie Menu is a fast way to perform actions without looking for tiny buttons.

*   **How to Activate**:
    *   **Tap on an icon**: Opens a menu specific to that target (e.g., Navigate To, Engage).
    *   **Long-press on the map**: Opens a general map menu (e.g., Drop Waypoint, Ruler Tool).
*   **How to Select**: Slide your finger toward the action you want and release. You will feel a small vibration (on touch devices) when you highlight an item.

## 3. Info Panels (HUD & Telemetry)

These panels show your current status (Heading, Height, Airspeed, Altitude).

*   **Customization**: You can move these panels to any of the four corners (Top-Left, Top-Right, etc.) using the settings.
*   **Declutter (DET)**: Toggle the "DET" button to hide or show detailed information, keeping only the most important numbers visible.

## 4. Top System Bar

Located at the top of the screen, this shows:
*   **Zulu Time**: Universal coordinated time used in aviation.
*   **System Health**: Quick status indicators for Radar (RDR), Electronic Warfare (EWS), and Sensors (EOS).

## 5. Left Sidebar (Quick Access)

The sidebar on the left allows you to quickly:
*   Toggle stabilization modes.
*   Access HUD settings.
*   Calibrate touch gestures.

## 6. Smart Command Bar (Command Palette)

The Smart Command Bar is a powerful tool for quickly executing commands and performing calculations.

*   **How to Open**: Use the keyboard shortcut (usually `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) or click the command icon.
*   **What you can do**:
    *   **Math Functions**: Enter math expressions like `sqrt(45)` or even shorthand like `cos45`.
    *   **Command History**: Easily access previous commands.
    *   **Fuzzy Search**: Type parts of a command name to find it quickly.
