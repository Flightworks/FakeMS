# Configuration & Customization

Fake MS allows you to tailor the interface to your specific needs.

## Visual Settings

You can adjust how the application looks in real-time:

*   **Panel Scale**: Make the info panels larger or smaller.
*   **Opacity (Alpha)**: Make the interface more or less transparent so you can see more of the map underneath.
*   **UI Glow**: Adjust the intensity of the "glow" effect on buttons and text for better visibility in different lighting conditions.

## Technical Settings

For those who want to dive deeper, several settings control how the map behaves:

*   **Gesture Calibration**: Adjust how sensitive the touch interface is to taps and holds.
*   **Animation Speed**: Control how fast the map "flies" to a new location when you center it.
*   **Map Tiles**: The application automatically caches map tiles for offline use, ensuring the map remains visible even if you lose internet connection during a mission.

## Advanced: Prototype Settings

The `PrototypeSettings` allows live manipulation of all variables. This is primarily used for testing and fine-tuning the "feel" of the tactile controls.
