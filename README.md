# Fake MS (Mission System)

**Fake MS** is a high-fidelity, tactile-first playground for **Human-Machine Interface (HMI) thought experiments**. Designed as a "Heads-Down Display" (HDD), it provides a flexible environment for designers to explore, prototype, and refine complex interface concepts.

## 🎨 Design & Experimentation

This isn't just a static mockup; it's a functioning sandbox for exploring:
- **Spatial Interaction**: How users manage data on a rotating tactical map.
- **Radial Workflows**: Testing the efficiency of Pie Menus for rapid tasking.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Real-time manipulation of UI scale, glow, and transparency.
- **Touch Ergonomics**: Fine-tuning control laws for modern touchscreens.
