## 🚁 Project Vision

**Fake MS** is designed as a "Heads-Down Display" (HDD) simulator for modern aviation and tactical systems. It serves as a functional sandbox for designers and developers to explore **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)** concepts without the overhead of real mission software.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a functional prototype built to test interaction control laws, gesture ergonomics, and complex spatial data visualization in real-time.

## ⚡ Tactical Features

### 🗺️ Advanced Tactical Map
Built on Leaflet and customized for mission-aware navigation:
- **Stabilization Modes**: Seamlessly toggle between `NORTH-UP` and `HEADING-UP` (Map-Centric vs. Ego-Centric).
- **WGS84 Precision**: All distance and bearing calculations use high-fidelity geodesic and spherical math.
- **Tactical Symbology**: Custom MIL-STD-style icons for Ownship, Hostiles, and Waypoints with velocity leaders.
- **Gesture Control**: Precision panning and zooming with support for pinch-to-zoom and long-press interaction.

### 🔘 Radial Interaction (Pie Menu)
Optimized for high-stress environments where tiny buttons fail:
- **Context-Aware**: Different menus for map, ownship, and target entities.
- **Flick-to-Select**: Fast, muscle-memory driven workflows with tactile/haptic feedback.
- **Ghost Buster**: Prevents accidental triggers on touch devices via advanced pointer filtering.

### ⌨️ Smart Command Bar (Scratchpad)
A powerful HUD tool combining natural language commands with a navigation computer:
- **Math Engine**: Native support for degrees in trig and complex expressions (e.g., `cos45`).
- **Coordinate Projection**: Project points using bearing/range shorthand (e.g., `HOSTILE1 180/5`).
- **Interactive Workspace**: Support for "Swipe Right to Execute" and "Drag-to-Map" workflows.
- **Fuzzy Search**: Instantly find entities or system commands (RADAR, EOTS, DCT).
